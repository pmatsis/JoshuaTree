- Expand upon or get rid of System_Request_Response_Status. If expanded, make it to either use generic response codes or REST-based ones

- Create a way to define, at runtime, user groups. This should mirror the functionality found in System_Security_Access_List. 

- JT-specific upload class. An abstract class with all of the basic upload functions and sub classes that extend it for specific file manipulation -- images, documents, video, etc..

- System_Utilities*
    -- Create an abstract base class for all system utilities to extend - array, string, date, etc.
    
- Update the Model and Db classes to a better code base that uses the SPL iterators correctly and allows for multiple database usages
    -- Separate the database logic from the model layer
    -- Allow models to make connections to other models through an add method
    -- Create a database connection controller that manages multiple connections and allows for fall through database connections
    
- Update the logging class

- Use Exceptions correct with logging and with the environment setting

- Use the event object (System_Event_Controller) in more places
    -- System_Request_Controller
    -- System_Database_Base
    -- System_View_Root
